His tweet fixation fuels a parasitic economy in which people compete to ride his digital coattails. Reporters, Democratic politicians, and social media influencers fall for it every time. They obsessively retweet, analyze and attack. This helps Trump tremendously.\nFirst, they ensure that he dominates the airwaves \u2013 and the brainwaves. By focusing massive attention on Trump\u2019s antics, they make him seem larger than life. This produces a cognitive effect called the \u201cfocusing illusion,\u201d and it helps explain how Trump ascended from political clown to the presidency. He turned the media into a Twitter news service.\nSecond, they spread his message. Constant repetition of Trump\u2019s words allows him to set the agenda. Like clockwork, his fellow tweet addicts \u2013 including his opponents \u2013 repeat every word. They enable him to embed his ideas and images into millions of brains, even yours. For example, which former presidential candidate comes to mind when you see the word \u201cCrooked\u201d? Trump got into your brain.\nThird, the continual anti-Trump outrage bolsters his credibility with his base. He can play the victim of the \u201cestablishment\u201d he promised to disrupt. He acts, but his opponents only react. He maintains heroic control.\nThe reasons why it works this way can be found in the cognitive sciences. By allowing Trump to constantly activate his ideas in our brains, we strengthen the neurocircuitry for those ideas. This allows Trump to dominate on a subconscious level \u2013 and 98 percent of thought is subconscious.\nTrump isn\u2019t a genius. He\u2019s a super salesman, and has been for most of his life.\nNow he\u2019s president, and our gullibility to his antics threatens our democracy. That\u2019s because Trump often uses social media to distract from what he\u2019s actually doing, like dismantling our government and robbing the working class to pay off the rich. He often uses his tweet tantrums to \u201cstep on\u201d big developments in the Russia investigation, creating a bigger story (\u201cnuclear button!\u201d) to distract attention.\nWith investigators closing in on Trump\u2019s possibly treasonous Russia dealings, think of him as a trapped rat with a Twitter account. His attempts to distract will only intensify, but we must stop falling for them.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean ignoring Trump. It means maintaining a steely focus on things that really matter, like the attack on our public institutions, the massive transfer of wealth and power to the rich, the resurgence of extreme racist politics, and the criminal investigation into the Trump Organization.\nLet\u2019s reclaim our power to decide what\u2019s important. Let\u2019s shrink Trump down to size. Let\u2019s take away his power to control our brains.\nIt turns out that we were all puppets. As long as we allow Trump to manipulate our public discourse with his fingertips, we\u2019ll remain puppets.

With the new appliance, IBM is looking to make analysis of so-called big data sets more affordable, said Steve Mills, senior vice president and group executive of software and systems at IBM.\nMills noted that the latest Netezza appliance is optimized for IBM's BladeCenter technology and is part of a broader portfolio focused on big data projects. IBM also has its BigInsights software, based on Hadoop, and its Streams application. The software is designed to analyze unstructured data on the fly.\nThe big pitch for Netezza is the price per user per terabyte. Mills said the Netezza appliance will run about $2,500 per user per terabye compared to an average of $10,000. \"This has an attractive price point when compared to other options,\" said Mills.\nThe Netezza appliance is clearly aimed at Oracle's Exadata appliances and other data warehousing systems from the likes of Teradata.\nSince closing the Netezza deal last November, IBM has focused on expanding the company's footprint abroad.

While this may have been a treat for some, it is not exactly the one most people affiliate with Nabisco's famous sandwich cookie.\nAnd so it was that Paul Figueiredo found himself in a legal dispute with one of the biggest food companies in the United States and Canada. Nabisco threatened a lawsuit if he didn't surrender the domain name by noon today.\nFigueiredo is not the first private person to tangle with a corporation over a Net domain name, and he certainly won't be the last. For now, the nation's major domain name registry, Network Solutions, hands out Net site addresses on a first-come, first-served basis. So it is easy to get a name, but it can be hard to keep.\nAt first, \"Oreos.com\" was registered to be the site for the Ontario Real Estate Online Services, for advertising homes on the market, Figueiredo says. But his business idea never took off. He had already spent $100 to register the site name, so he turned it into a home page. When he got the letter from Nabisco's lawyers earlier this month, he knew the site's days were numbered.\n\"I don't want to fight these people.

Those snakes will include pythons, rattlesnakes, copperheads, king snakes, worm snakes and a few exotic snakes, according to Cash.\nAthens is home to a wide variety of native snakes.

These programs are easy to join and make it simple to keep track of your total miles.\nMost airlines offer a frequent flyer program that allows travelers to accumulate air miles in a frequent flyer account. Miles can be earned both by flying and by participating in various other spending opportunities, such as renting a car or using a mileage credit card. The miles can be used to book travel or upgrade a seat on future flights. Airline miles are like a type of currency, although there's technically no monetary value to them. Many travelers pick a favorite airline and prefer to keep all their miles in one place to help earn airline status and get free flights.\nIf you are already a member of a frequent flyer program, like American Airlines' AAdvantage or United Airlines' MileagePlus, and you have been including your frequent flyer number on your travel reservation, log in to your account to see your total number of miles, available online or in the airline's app. When you visit an airline's website, look for the login tab or box to access your account. For example on the United website, click on the MileagePlus tab. Most apps keep you logged in, so your total miles should immediately appear on the initial page. You should see both your total miles and the number of miles you've logged this year, as well as your airline status (if any).\nCall the airline if you don't know your login for the website or app. Customer service will also be able to provide your mileage total.\nIf you haven't joined a frequent flyer program but do fly a lot, it's still possible to claim some miles. Fill out the enrollment form online for a specific airline (or for several if you have potential miles on various airlines) and keep track of your new membership number. Travelers must be 18 years old to join most frequent flyer programs. It's possible to request credit for recent flights as a new member, although some restrictions will likely apply. For example, United's MileagePlus program allows new members to request credit for qualifying flights that took place up to 30 days prior to the enrollment date. For a fee of $50, new members can ask for credit for flights up to six months prior. Check with your chosen airline for its policy on retroactive credit.\nOnce you have enough miles, you can book a free flight or use the miles to upgrade an existing reservation to business or first class. Each airline's website has a booking page for rewards bookings to check for possible flights. Be sure to log in to your mileage plus account before booking. Some airlines offer various types of rewards fares so it's always best to do some research and look into what option is the best use of your miles vs. your money.

A very sophisticated fishing tribe called the Chinchoros, who lived on the north coast of what is now Chile, were embalming their dead as early as 5000 B.C.\nChinchoros embalmers disassembled their corpses, treated the internal organs to prevent decay, and then reassembled the pieces. They often added cane or wood supports along the spinal column, arms and legs, filled in the body cavity with fiber or feathers, and coated the exterior of the body with clay, on which they painted or sculpted. Infants, children and adults of both sexes were mummified, though some corpses received more attention than others.\nFurther north, another coastal group at Paloma were mummifying their dead as early as 4000 B.C. The Palomans used salt to stop decay and carefully positioned their dead with knees drawn to the chest and hands clasped. The bodies were then wrapped in reed matting and buried under the floor of their existing homes.\nBy the time of the Inca civilization, which lasted from approximately 1100 to 1500 A.D., the Andean tradition of preserving the dead was still intact. Most Inca mummies were arranged in the familiar fetal position and were either wrapped in leather or cloth, or placed in baskets or under huge ceramic jars. These \"mummy bundles\" were often brightly decorated and buried with food, clothing and other items. Some archaeologists believe that the Inca mummified all their dead, not just the elite.\nIn 1875, archaeologists did manage to uncover a huge burial site at Anc\u00f3n on the Peruvian coast. Hundreds of shafts, some eighteen to twenty feet deep, led to tombs where extremely well-preserved mummies bundles were found. Apparently, the dry climate and high salt content of the region had helped to prevent decay. The mummies were wrapped in cloth, seaweed, leaves, grass matting and furs. Many bundles were topped with a sort of false head, decorated with eyes that stared out into the darkness of the tomb.\nPerhaps the most remarkable Incan mummies have been those found on high mountain peaks, where the Inca offered human sacrifices to their Gods. Over the years, some 115 of these sacrificial mummies have been found in the high Andes. In 1995, Dr. Johan Reinhard stumbled upon the body of a young girl, barely into her teens, on top of Mount Ampato in the Peruvian Andes. Named \"Juanita,\" she is the best-preserved Incan mummy ever discovered. With long black hair, a graceful neck, and well-muscled arms, Juanita was found wrapped in a cocoon of fine textiles and surrounded by gold and silver statues, bags of corn and other offerings. The goal of this, Reinhard's latest expedition, is to locate more of these mummies and expand our understanding of Incan sacrificial rites.\nPhotos: (2) courtesy The Mountain Institute.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Egyptians", "entity": "Egyptians", "start": 18, "end": 27, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "mummy makers", "entity": "Egyptians", "start": 50, "end": 62, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptians", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Chile", "entity": "Chile", "start": 196, "end": 201, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Inca", "entity": "Inca Empire", "start": 1040, "end": 1044, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Inca", "entity": "Inca Empire", "start": 1177, "end": 1181, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Inca", "entity": "Inca Empire", "start": 1466, "end": 1470, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Anc\u00f3n", "entity": "Anc\u00f3n District", "start": 1585, "end": 1590, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anc\u00f3n_District", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Peruvian", "entity": "Peru", "start": 1598, "end": 1606, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Incan", "entity": "Inca Empire", "start": 2057, "end": 2062, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Inca", "entity": "Inca Empire", "start": 2127, "end": 2131, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Dr.", "entity": "Johan Reinhard", "start": 2270, "end": 2273, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Reinhard", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Johan Reinhard", "entity": "Johan Reinhard", "start": 2274, "end": 2288, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Reinhard", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Mount Ampato", "entity": "Ampato", "start": 2362, "end": 2374, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampato", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Peruvian", "entity": "Peru", "start": 2382, "end": 2390, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Incan", "entity": "Inca Empire", "start": 2441, "end": 2446, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Reinhard", "entity": "Johan Reinhard", "start": 2682, "end": 2690, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Reinhard", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Incan", "entity": "Inca Empire", "start": 2779, "end": 2784, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca_Empire", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "The Mountain Institute", "entity": "The Mountain Institute", "start": 2825, "end": 2847, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mountain_Institute", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}]}}

However, it certainly hasn\u2019t suffered by its lack of gentrification and the wider Glockenbach quarter is a pretty hip place, with numerous interesting bars, caf\u00e9s and restaurants.

But such a scenario is not likely to happen, according to a British expert on connected and autonomous driving.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainties at the moment. We are not sure whether these tech companies are going to be competitors or possible collaborators,\u201d said professor Paul Jennings, head of intelligent vehicle development at Warwick Manufacturing Group, in an interview with The Korea Herald in Daegu on Thursday.\nWMG is an academia-industry partnership on future car development in the UK, where the professor has worked more than 25 years. Jennings is a physicist who has led the development of intelligent vehicles and energy storage in collaboration with WMG\u2019s industrial and academic partners.\nAsked what carmakers should do in order to maintain their growth, Jennings advised they need to think beyond the conventional frame of selling cars and instead focus more on services.\n\u201cWhat they need to recognize is that the industry, as well as the culture, is changing very rapidly as we are moving towards service-driven industries. They also need to make sure that they adapt to their own businesses, without fearing (newly rising tech companies),\u201d he said.\nJennings, who also serves as a principal investigator on the OmniCAV project, was in South Korea\u2019s southeastern city of Daegu last week to speak about the progress of UK\u2019s development on self-driving and connected cars.\nOmniCAV is a 2.7 million-pound ($3.5 million) project to create the new testing frame for connected and self-driving vehicles. WMG has been working with a team of 11 other organizations, including Oxford-based Latent Logic. The group recently won a funding competition run by the Center for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles and Innovate UK.\nThe scheme is to create a highly accurate virtual reality simulator environment by providing highly detailed scans of real roads, traffic camera data and artificial intelligence-trained pedestrian models.\n\u201cOur vision was to bring the city to us, so people sitting inside vehicles may experience the city or any other environment just as if it is real,\u201d he said.\nWhile the complexity of human behavior remains a challenge, Jennings is using artificial intelligence-trained pedestrian models so that driverless vehicles could learn how to react to people in various situations.\n\u201cWe need very sophisticated algorithms to mimic the real world, and that is why we use AI. A resemblance to real life experience is required, instead of a simplistic representation,\u201d he said.\nWMG is hoping that partnership with South Korean companies may help the universal goal of improving the safety of self-driving cars. The group is also working with a number of European carmakers and universities, seeking to attain the level three autonomy.\nAccording to a figure in the UK, over 90 percent of vehicle accidents are attributable to human error, he pointed out.\n\u201cBy eliminating human error, we will not only save numerous lives, but also cut down on the social cost caused by accidents,\u201d he said.",

Tube feeders can be hung in places that are difficult for squirrels to reach, which is a big plus in my book.\nTray feeders. Platform or tray feeders are just that \u2013 a flat surface that holds birdseed on top. Unless situated carefully, they are easily raided by squirrels. They also need to be cleaned quite regularly to avoid serving birds seed that has been spoiled by rain or the droppings of previous diners. If you are interested in attracting doves, jays and other ground-feeding birds, be sure to set your tray feeders at a low elevation.\nHouse feeders. House feeders are what springs to my mind when I think \u201cbird feeder.\u201d These are covered platforms, often with partial side walls, that do indeed resemble tiny houses. House feeders, also known as hopper feeders, can be mounted on poles or hung from branches. They are not particularly squirrel resistant, however.\nOther feeders. Other feeder types include thistle feeders \u2013 tube-shaped with tiny openings for narrow thistle seed that is preferred by a variety of small birds, such as finches; suet feeders that are made of wire and hold suet mixture that is particularly attractive to woodpeckers, nuthatches and other birds; window feeders that can attach by suction cups to your windows and provide birdwatchers a closer view; and hummingbird feeders that hold nectar for these tiny and colorful birds.\nBlack oil sunflower seeds are what I usually stock in my tube feeder. They appeal to small birds like chickadees, cardinals, finches, nuthatches and some woodpeckers. Sometimes smaller birds are chased away by bigger birds, which can be a problem. According to the Birds and Blooms website (birdsandblooms.com), one solution is to offer a second option: Nyjer or thistle seed is not usually attractive to these larger bullies.\nBlack-oil sunflower seeds attract the largest variety of birds and may be fed in tube or house feeders. Shelled sunflower seeds are also available for those willing to pay a higher price. The benefit is avoiding the mess that shells make when discarded by hungry birds.\nStriped sunflower seeds are also nutritious, but the shells may be too hard for some smaller birds to open.\nSafflower is another type of seed served in house feeders but with a special advantage: they are largely ignored by squirrels \u2013 thus eliminating one of the most vexing problems in most yards.\nCracked or whole kernel corn is also an option. Along with Eastern bluebirds and other songbirds, game birds such as pheasants will visit a platform feeder where corn is served. But remember that rodents, raccoons and possums will also be tempted to dine.\nFinally, almost every source I consulted warned that cheap birdseed mixes are best avoided as less nutritious and less tempting for most types of desirable bird species.\nContact Renee Elder at wildlifechatter@gmail.com.\nIf you are interested in seeing particular types of birds at your birdfeeder, here are some suggested favorites from wild-bird-watching.com.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Cornell Lab of Ornithology", "entity": "Cornell Lab of Ornithology", "start": 17, "end": 43, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_Lab_of_Ornithology", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "House", "entity": "House", "start": 709, "end": 714, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "House", "entity": "House", "start": 891, "end": 896, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Birds and Blooms", "entity": "Birds & Blooms", "start": 1794, "end": 1810, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_&_Blooms", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "website", "entity": "Birds & Blooms", "start": 1811, "end": 1818, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_&_Blooms", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "birdsandblooms.com", "entity": "Birds & Blooms", "start": 1820, "end": 1838, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_&_Blooms", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "Nyjer", "entity": "Guizotia abyssinica", "start": 1883, "end": 1888, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guizotia_abyssinica", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "wildlifechatter@gmail.com", "entity": "Gmail", "start": 2975, "end": 3000, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "wild-bird-watching.com", "entity": "Birdwatching", "start": 3119, "end": 3141, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdwatching", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}]}}

The same goes for guitar tabs, which tell you where to put your fingers, not what the notes are.\nSo, if you want to learn a song, it's best to hear someone playing it decompressed, while using the notation as an aide-m\u00e9moire.\nThis isn't an easy thing to do, especially in the repetitive way that's necessary to learn a song.\nOr it wasn't until Adrian Holovaty and PJ Macklin created Soundslice, a beautiful HTML5 app that syncs professional studio recordings with sheet music and guitar tablature. Soundslice debuted in late 2012, but they released a new version of the software for sheet music yesterday, and it's wonderful. You can check out the functions in the video below.\nBut really, go play around with the app. There's a nice version of \"Auld Lang Syne.\" Do it on any device. Phone, tablet, laptop. Soundslice works beautifully. Not just functionally, but smoothly, responsively. Writer, developer, and all around web guy Paul Ford said that \"it sings,\" and that's a great way of putting it.\nAnd it sings everywhere, or as Holovaty put it to me and Ford on Twitter, \"HTML5 FTW! Screw native apps and their walled gardens.\" The problem with that has always been speed. Generally speaking, native apps respond to touch better; you caress, they respond. HTML5 apps tend to be laggier and just don't have that polished, quick feel.

The sale was made after the home was no longer on the market.\nPublic records show it was at no point under contract for sale while it was listed, and there was no notice of settlement, which is a document filed with the county recording office that protects a potential buyer from someone else trying to buy the same property.\nThe county recording office said Nicastro's deed change is in process and should be completed by next week.\nOther Howell officials told the Press he's \"renting in town,\" but could not provide an address or additional details.\nA Township Council meeting scheduled for Oct. 23 was canceled.\nVoter registration records checked by the Press show Nicastro still lists his Stream Bank Drive home as his residence.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Howell", "entity": "Howell Township, New Jersey", "start": 20, "end": 26, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howell_Township,_New_Jersey", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Asbury Park Press", "entity": "Asbury Park Press", "start": 397, "end": 414, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbury_Park_Press", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Press", "entity": "Asbury Park Press", "start": 528, "end": 533, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbury_Park_Press", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Rutgers University", "entity": "Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick", "start": 868, "end": 886, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University\u2013New_Brunswick", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "New Brunswick", "entity": "New Brunswick, New Jersey", "start": 888, "end": 901, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick,_New_Jersey", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Multiple Listing Service", "entity": "Multiple listing service", "start": 1323, "end": 1347, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_listing_service", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "Howell", "entity": "Howell Township, New Jersey", "start": 1833, "end": 1839, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howell_Township,_New_Jersey", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Press", "entity": "Asbury Park Press", "start": 1859, "end": 1864, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbury_Park_Press", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Press", "entity": "Asbury Park Press", "start": 2050, "end": 2055, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbury_Park_Press", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}]}}

Buried among the hundreds of pages published on Wednesday, there\u2019s reference to the two sides pursuing comprehensive arrangements in their future relationship, \u2018building on the single customs territory\u2019 set out in the draft divorce treaty.\nAccording to a Guardian report the UK was understood to have agreed that an independent arbitration committee will judge when a UK-wide customs backstop could be terminated, comprised of an equal number of British and EU representatives plus an independent element.\nMinisters were expected to study the Northern Ireland specific elements in the backstop deal. A Guardian report quoting UK government sources said the region would not be treated differently in customs terms, although Brussels sources said Northern Ireland would have special status in the backstop in terms of the customs union and single market.\nAccording to the available information, the British negotiating team won a victory in persuading Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator that the detail of any fisheries arrangement will be in the political declaration.\nThe backstop will also require the UK to maintain a \u201clevel playing field\u201d with the EU on social and environmental regulation, with negotiators understood to have \u201cheavily boosted\u201d what that will mean with clear detail.\nIn almost 600 pages of documents released late on Wednesday, there were three short paragraphs devoted to financial services. Under the envisioned regime, the UK will be dependent upon EU goodwill; Brussels officials will have unilateral power to shut the door on short notice if they determine there\u2019s not a level regulatory playing field.\nEven if the UK Parliament clears the Brexit agreement \u2014 and that\u2019s still far from a sure thing \u2014 negotiations on a new financial rule book will continue well into 2020. The bottom line is that banks, brokers and asset managers continue to face talks going off the rails.\n\u201cOur message to businesses continues to be: prepare for the worst, hope \u2014 and advocate vigorously \u2014 for the best,\u201d Charles Brasted, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, said in a statement.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Dubai", "entity": "Dubai", "start": 0, "end": 5, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Brexit", "entity": "Brexit", "start": 24, "end": 30, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "United Kingdom", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 109, "end": 123, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Brexit", "entity": "Brexit", "start": 179, "end": 185, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "UK", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 236, "end": 238, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Guardian", "entity": "The Guardian", "start": 550, "end": 558, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "UK", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 570, "end": 572, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "UK", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 663, "end": 665, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "British", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 741, "end": 748, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Northern Ireland", "entity": "Northern Ireland", "start": 838, "end": 854, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "A Guardian", "entity": "The Guardian", "start": 895, "end": 905, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "UK", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 921, "end": 923, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Northern Ireland", "entity": "Northern Ireland", "start": 1041, "end": 1057, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "British", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 1193, "end": 1200, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Michel Barnier", "entity": "Michel Barnier", "start": 1246, "end": 1260, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "chief negotiator", "entity": "Michel Barnier", "start": 1271, "end": 1287, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "UK", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 1406, "end": 1408, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "UK", "entity": "United Kingdom", "start": 1749, "end": 1751, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "UK Parliament", "entity": "Parliament of the United Kingdom", "start": 1943, "end": 1956, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "law firm", "entity": "Hogan Lovells", "start": 2351, "end": 2359, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan_Lovells", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Hogan Lovells", "entity": "Hogan Lovells", "start": 2360, "end": 2373, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan_Lovells", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}]}}

Below we count down our five favorites.\nHank died the way he lived -- without compromise. This pretty much put the nail in the coffin for viewers holding out hope that Walt would be able to negotiate for Hank's life. But Hank knew he was a goner, telling Walt, \"You want me to beg? You're the smartest guy I ever met, and you're too stupid to see -- he made up his mind 10 minutes ago.\"\nThis is an unspeakably cruel moment. Not only has Walt signed off on Jesse being tortured and killed by Todd, but he revisited the cruelest thing he's done to Jesse and used it to hurt him even more. It's also a callback to season three's \"The Fly,\" when an addled Walt apologized to Jesse and nearly confessed his role in Jane's death. In that case, he was contrite, but here there is nothing but malice.\nAfter seasons of dumping on Skyler (Anna Gunn), Walt Jr. finally sees his dad for who he is -- and takes a stand against him. Like Gomez showing up to help Hank, Walt Jr. finally realizing the truth about his father is something viewers have been waiting for.\nAt first it seems like cruelty, but Walt gives Skyler an alibi here, performing for the police officers he clearly knows are listening in on the conversation. Walt tweaks the history of the last year, making it seem like he threatened Skyler at every turn in order to get her to become involved in the business. That wasn't the case. Walt is truly playing a different type of game here.\nIt's on. Like \"tread lightly\" in the first of the final eight episodes, Walt's final words set up the showdown that is to come in the final two. We can only assume he'll plan an intricate revenge against the Aryan gang. And we hope the plan will somehow put things in motion that will free Jesse, though we aren't counting on it considering how crushing this episode was.\nWhat was your favorite line?

The Stonic brings a solid, intense driving experience with elegant manoeuvrability.\nThe youngest of the Kia family comes packed with intelligent functionalities including bi-projection headlamps, side-mirror repeaters, skid plates, three-dimensional rear lights and more, making the Stonic as much practical as it is stunning.\nA glance at the car's interior immediately shows that it has been beautifully thought out to provide comfortable and safe mobility with every journey. Use of space is expertly designed to give the Stonic a roomy feeling in a compact shell.

From the D-cut steering wheel, to the stitching on the seats, every part of the interior demonstrates style and quality.\nThe Stonic is serious on safety and comes loaded with smart features that make the difference when it really matters. Kia's DriveWise technology protects the driver and passengers with intelligent systems such as blind-spot collision alert, driver attention signal, and lane departure warning.\nThe All-New Kia Stonic is an exciting package combining forward-looking aesthetics with day-to-day practicality.

It was a different time, when America wasn\u2019t going to put up with Russia bossing us around, and it was up to Rocky to teach the Soviet Union a lesson so that Russia would never mess with us again. That certainly worked out for us, right?\nHow many training montages does this movie have? Seriously, try to keep count. There\u2019s almost a training montage in a training montage, even though this Honest Trailer comes from all the way back in 1985, before we had a word to easily describe something like that thanks to the vision of director Christopher Nolan. But I digress.\nIt\u2019s kind of amazing that audiences were willing to let a movie about an up and coming boxer reach this level. It not only becomes comical because of how two-dimensional the new villain is, especially with only 46 words for Dolph Lundgren to say throughout the entire movie, but also because there\u2019s a damn robot in this movie. What was Sylvester Stallone smoking in the 1980s?\nAnyway, thank the maker that Creed II is here to clean things up a bit by bringing back Ivan Drago, this time with his kid Viktor Drago, so America can teach Russia that they can\u2019t mess with us again, unless of course the puppet that is our president says it\u2019s okay.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Creed II", "entity": "Creed II", "start": 5, "end": 13, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_II", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "Rocky IV", "entity": "Rocky IV", "start": 191, "end": 199, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_IV", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "rage", "entity": "Rocky IV", "start": 212, "end": 216, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_IV", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "America", "entity": "United States", "start": 248, "end": 255, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Russia", "entity": "Russia", "start": 284, "end": 290, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Soviet Union", "entity": "Soviet Union", "start": 346, "end": 358, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Russia", "entity": "Russia", "start": 376, "end": 382, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "director", "entity": "Christopher Nolan", "start": 745, "end": 753, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Christopher Nolan", "entity": "Christopher Nolan", "start": 754, "end": 771, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Dolph Lundgren", "entity": "Dolph Lundgren", "start": 1012, "end": 1026, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolph_Lundgren", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Sylvester Stallone", "entity": "Sylvester Stallone", "start": 1125, "end": 1143, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Stallone", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Creed II", "entity": "Creed II", "start": 1195, "end": 1203, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creed_II", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "Ivan Drago", "entity": "Ivan Drago", "start": 1254, "end": 1264, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Drago", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "America", "entity": "United States", "start": 1306, "end": 1313, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Russia", "entity": "Russia", "start": 1324, "end": 1330, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}]}}

For traditional tourism activities, visitors to the area have all of the attractions of greater Philadelphia within a short drive. However, for those looking for more laid-back entertainment, Voorhees has plenty to do, right in town.\nThe Voorhees Township Parks Department operates a network of parks and sports facilities for year-round public use. You can enjoy warmer months picnicking at Connolly Park or Lions Lake Complex. Both have playgrounds for children, picnic tables and lawns. Lions Lake also features grills, a concession stand and a banquet hall. Connolly Park has covered gazebos and designated areas for dogs. Athletes can play baseball or football at Giangiulio Sports Complex and softball, basketball, bocce ball or tennis at Kirkwood Sports Complex. Maiaroto Sports Complex features a soccer field as well as basketball and tennis facilities. Rabinowitz Sports Complex is devoted to baseball, with multiple lighted fields as well as batting cages. All parks are open from sunrise to sunset. You must file an application to reserve sports fields for use at any of the sports complexes.\nWatch a local dance troupe at Voorhees Ballet Theatre (voorheesballettheatre.com). Since 1986, the group has given two major performances each year and smaller shows at local community centers. The Voorhees Theatre Company (voorheestheatre.org) primarily presents children's theater, plus the occasional performance by adult actors.\nIn addition to the basic sports facilities available through Voorhees' parks system, the town is home to Flyers Skate Zone (voorhees.flyersskatezone.com), an indoor ice skating rink that's open for regular public skating sessions, figure skating lessons, birthday parties and ice hockey clubs, camps, clinics and tournaments. While much of the programming is oriented toward younger skaters, an adult ice hockey league also operates out of the center.\nIn spite of its proximity to Philadelphia, Voorhees also has plenty of natural vistas, ideal for hiking. Stafford Farm, a historic farm operated for more than 225 years, sits right in the township. Since 2004, the 140-acre farm has been protected by the Trust for Public Land, and it is open to visitors for hiking and birding. The protected area includes Stafford Woods, an area spanning approximately 5 acres, which features public bikeways.\nHill, Danielle. \"Activities in Voorhees, New Jersey.\" Travel Tips - USA Today, https://traveltips.usatoday.com/activities-voorhees-new-jersey-103109.html.

Telefonica\u2019s chairman, Cesar Alierta, was flying to London on Thursday afternoon to help lobby for his side.\nA deal with Telefonica would return O2 to its original owner, as it was demerged from a heavily indebted BT via a share flotation in 2001 and subsequently bought by Telefonica in early 2006.\nA return to the mobile market now would give BT a strong position as the UK consumer telecoms market converges with single operators offering \u201cmulti-play\u201d packages of fixed and mobile broadband, telephony and pay-TV services.\nBut among the issues the BT board has to weigh up is whether it would rather have Telefonica, or France\u2019s Orange and Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom on its shareholder register.\nTelefonica has had a famously difficult relationship with a previous partner, Telecom Italia, where it has been its largest shareholder but is now in a gradual process of selling out.\nTelefonica is also seen as the most aggressive among the three companies and its ambition to consolidate the markets where it operates could in the long run lead them to eye more control over BT, said one of the sources.\nOrange and Deutsche have also had a sometimes strained relationship in running EE.\nSymptomatic of the heightened state of merger activity in the telecoms industry as services converge, Hutchison\u2019s 3 Group is expected to shortly line up a bid for

No, not that invasion.\nAt the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), U.S. Army troops infiltrated the Los AngelesConvention Center. Special Forces officers, clad in fatigues and carrying machine guns, descended from Black Hawk helicopters and stormed the front doors. Traffic stopped. Civilians fled. And yet, somehow, the incident went relatively unnoticed by the mainstream press.\nThe invasion was not, in fact, a terrorist cell bust-up, but instead an elaborate promotion for America's Army, the official Army videogame released in 2002. As Halter explains, this E3 publicity stunt profoundly illustrates a fusion of war and gaming. But the relationship, sometimes called \"the military-entertainment complex,\" is really nothing new.\nFrom Sun Tzu to Xbox traces the evolution of war gaming throughout history, from its roots in board games like chess and go, to the Cold War-era battle simulations built by the Department of Defense, to modern day first-person shooters and tactical sims funded by the military. To do this, Halter examines almost every military-themed videogame ever made. But the real heart of From Sun Tzu To Xbox is the relationship between war and videogames, and how each influences the other.\nWhat's most appealing about the book is its evenhandedness toward its subjects. Although Halter asks tough questions that have few answers, From Sun Tzu to Xbox is no radical diatribe against the evils of the military machine. Instead, the book is a thoughtful, measured approach to one of today's most intriguing political and philosophical quandaries: where does war end and entertainment begin? Even readers who've never seen a PS2 or wouldn't know an AK-47 from an M16 should find it an entertaining, enlightening read.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Ed Halter", "entity": "Ed Halter", "start": 0, "end": 9, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Halter", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "From Sun Tzu to Xbox: War and Video Games", "entity": "From Sun Tzu to Xbox", "start": 12, "end": 53, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Sun_Tzu_to_Xbox", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "Electronic Entertainment Expo", "entity": "E3", "start": 169, "end": 198, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.CONSUMER_GOOD"}, {"mention": "E3", "entity": "E3", "start": 200, "end": 202, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.CONSUMER_GOOD"}, {"mention": "U.S. Army", "entity": "United States Army", "start": 205, "end": 214, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Special Forces", "entity": "Special forces", "start": 268, "end": 282, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "America's Army", "entity": "America's Army", "start": 615, "end": 629, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Army", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Army", "entity": "United States Army", "start": 644, "end": 648, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Halter", "entity": "Ed Halter", "start": 680, "end": 686, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Halter", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "E3", "entity": "E3", "start": 702, "end": 704, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E3", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.CONSUMER_GOOD"}, {"mention": "Cold War", "entity": "Cold War", "start": 1004, "end": 1012, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.EVENT"}, {"mention": "Department of Defense", "entity": "United States Department of Defense", "start": 1049, "end": 1070, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Halter", "entity": "Ed Halter", "start": 1162, "end": 1168, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Halter", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "From Sun Tzu To Xbox", "entity": "From Sun Tzu to Xbox", "start": 1250, "end": 1270, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Sun_Tzu_to_Xbox", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "Halter", "entity": "Ed Halter", "start": 1443, "end": 1449, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Halter", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "From Sun Tzu", "entity": "From Sun Tzu to Xbox", "start": 1494, "end": 1506, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Sun_Tzu_to_Xbox", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "AK-47", "entity": "AK-47", "start": 1809, "end": 1814, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AK-47", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}]}}

In particular, the rules give insurers more flexibility in using estimates of future losses when making a case for a rate increase -- a change Rosenfield said would allow insurance companies to \"game the regulatory system.\"\nThe rules were adopted on an emergency basis with little opportunity for public comment. They must be approved by the state Office of Administrative Law to go into effect.\nThe expedited approval process was necessary so that the rules could be in place as auto insurers try to meet a July 14 deadline for drawing up new rate plans, Tucker said. The department has said in the past that the existing rules were confusing insurers.\nThe insurance industry applauded the changes pertaining to future-loss calculations. However, the industry wants rate requests to be judged on an individual company's financial situation rather than on statewide industry averages, said Sam Sorich, president of the Assn. of California Insurance Cos.\n\"The existing regulations are so constraining that they don't allow an individual company to show its case\" for a rate change, Sorich said.", "entity_info": [{"mention":

Al Sharpton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich don\u2019t agree on much, but a meeting with a group of inner-city charter school students on Tuesday left them with the same impression: There is hope for improving the U.S. education system.\nSharpton, a liberal Democrat, and Gingrich, a conservative Republican, joined Education Secretary Arne Duncan on the first stop of a \u201clistening and learning\u201d tour to find out which school strategies are working and why.\nThe odd couple of Gingrich and Sharpton found common ground in the concept that education is the new frontier on civil rights. President Barack Obama has a goal of turning around 5,000 failing schools across the U.S. in the next five years.\nAt Mastery, the trio met with about a dozen 11th graders who attended the school four years earlier when it was under district management. At that time, students said, kids ran wild, expectations were low and teachers didn\u2019t care about the students \u2014 or even about teaching.\n\u201cIt was horrible,\u201d 17-year-old Donnell Clark said.\nBut since 2006, the school has been run by Mastery Charter Schools, a nonprofit that now has four campuses in Philadelphia serving 2,100 students. The Shoemaker campus visited Tuesday has outperformed some of its more affluent suburban counterparts on state standardized tests.\nClark and others told the education advocates that new teachers and staff made the difference by raising the academic bar, accepting no excuses and simply caring about their students.\n\u201cTeachers actually invest their time,\u201d Clark said.\nPublic education in Philadelphia is a mixture of district-run schools, schools operated by private management companies and charter schools, which are public but operate independently from the district.\nIt is a high-poverty system where only about half the students can read and write at grade level. But bright spots like Mastery make Superintendent Arlene Ackerman optimistic that the district is \u201cin a breakthrough mode,\u201d and that a combination of reforms may be the best way to help students.\nAckerman, who sat in on the tour, plans to pursue a \u201crenaissance\u201d strategy similar to one Duncan did when he was schools chief in Chicago. Philadelphia\u2019s first cohort of \u201crenaissance schools,\u201d to be identified later this fall, will be essentially shut down in June and reopened next fall with new staffs and new academic focus.\nGingrich, Sharpton and Duncan also visited Delaplaine McDaniel Elementary School in Philadelphia, a high-poverty school run by the district that met federal education standards for several consecutive years.\nGingrich said both schools give him \u201ca sense of great hope\u201d for bettering the U.S. education system, which lags many of its international counterparts.\nWhen Mastery students talked about teachers not caring, Sharpton said he was reminded of his own school days. And hearing that achievement changed when expectations did \u201ctells me a lot about what we have to do nationally on education reform,\u201d he said.\nBesides visiting classrooms, the group also had closed meetings with teachers, administrators and parents, where they were expected to discuss Obama\u2019s education reform initiatives.\nFuture tour stops include New Orleans on Nov. 3 and Baltimore on Nov. 13.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Rev.

Kids whose moms ate nuts most often were actually less likely to have problems consuming them, researchers found.\nPeanut allergies are on the rise and affect up to 2 percent of the population in the United States and other Western countries. Women were once advised to avoid nuts in pregnancy to avoid triggering allergies in their offspring, but that advice was later rescinded. Studies went back and forth, and some even suggested that avoiding nuts during pregnancy increased a child's chances of being allergic to them.\nThe new research supports that theory. It involves more than 8,000 children born to female nurses in a long-running U.S. study that periodically asked questions about diet and health habits.\nDoctors and tests confirmed that 140 children had allergies to peanuts or tree nuts such as walnuts, almonds or pecans. Fifty-eight had mothers who were allergic to nuts, and 82 did not. Looking at this second group, researchers found that children whose moms ate nuts at least five times a month were 69 percent less likely to have nut allergies than those whose moms rarely ate nuts.\n\"Our study adds to the evidence that early exposure to allergens might be a way that you induce tolerance,\" but is not the kind of research that can prove cause and effect, said Dr. Michael Young, a pediatrician at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital Boston.\nHe led the study, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.\nA big caveat: Researchers had no information on fathers' nut allergies, which could pass to a child. Allergies can be inherited, \"but the maternal component seems to be more relevant\" than the father's genes, Young said.\nIn any case, the results support the advice that women should not restrict their diets in pregnancy unless they are allergic to nuts, Dr. Ruchi Gupta of Northwestern University wrote in a commentary in the journal.\nPeanuts are a good source of protein and folic acid, which helps prevent certain birth defects, Gupta noted. \"Mothers-to-be should feel free to curb their cravings with a dollop of peanut butter!\"\nThe Food Allergy Research and Education, a New York-based nonprofit group that advocates for people with allergies and gets some funding from industry sources, sponsored the work but had no role in designing or running the study.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "United States", "entity": "United States", "start": 357, "end": 370, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "U.S.", "entity": "United States", "start": 798, "end": 802, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "Dr.", "entity": "Michael Young (baseball)", "start": 1437, "end": 1440, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Young_(baseball)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Michael Young", "entity": "Michael Young (baseball)", "start": 1441, "end": 1454, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Young_(baseball)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "pediatrician", "entity": "Michael Young (baseball)", "start": 1458, "end": 1470, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Young_(baseball)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Harvard Medical School", "entity": "Harvard Medical School", "start": 1474, "end": 1496, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Children's Hospital Boston", "entity": "Boston Children\u2019s Hospital", "start": 1501, "end": 1527, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Children\u2019s_Hospital", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "JAMA Pediatrics", "entity": "JAMA Pediatrics", "start": 1567, "end": 1582, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_Pediatrics", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "Young", "entity": "Michael Young (baseball)", "start": 1793, "end": 1798, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Young_(baseball)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Northwestern University", "entity": "Northwestern University", "start": 1958, "end": 1981, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}]}}

No more time travelling - this is the period where the machines wake up, the human race hardens up, and the CIA stops pushing too many pencils. Terminator Salvation the game, is set just before the events of the movie, we reviewed it on PS3.\nTerminator is a 3rd person cover shooter that you can play solo or split screen with someone next to you. The machines have some heavy duty firepower, so you and your squad will need to rely heavily on shoot & move tactics, which suits the movies perfectly. Each new room will contain several bits of cover, a la Gears of War, and your health won't go back up until the firefight is over. If you're pinned down on 10% health with no ammo, you're already dead. You just don't know it yet.\nEmphasis is placed on flanking, and there's always some side path that'll take you right round the robotic rear. Even if they just follow you, you're squadmates are smart enough to pop em in the back.\nYeah, useful squadmates are a good thing. When you're out of ammo, they'll chuck you some. When you get flanked, they let you know.\nTerminator also tries to build an emotional bond between player and squadmate, and fails completely, I didn't care whether they lived or died, but at least while they're alive, they do stuff. One thing that baffled me though, and it's relentless, no one in the game can stop saying the name John Connor!\nWaaah, get these people some air!\nAnd for a linear game, sometimes it can be hard to find the way, and without a jump button it's annoying being unable to get over a 3 foot piece of concrete. You will spend most of your time behind that concrete though, the machines target you specifically if you're out of cover.\nLike any Star Wars game, it benefits heavily from that memorable franchise music. You could show anything to this music and it would sound epic. I could show you Glados the cat.\nThat is one epic cat, man. I'm actually kinda scared!\nNothing. There is no multiplayer, and after finishing, no real reason to come back to it. It's quite short, and while some levels were fun, I think it fits snugly into that well deserved stigma that movie games have Jung.\nI had to wonder, with these games, has the bar just been set really high? I mean, after a level of CoD4, you feel like putting it down because it's so intense. After a level of Terminator, you're like, this is kinda fun, but I hope it gets better...A great example is the giant boss they show you early on...which you NEVER get to fight!\nAbout ready for final thoughts?\nAs far as movie games go, it's more fun than usual. Sliding from cover to cover is pretty cool. But it is very much a movie game. It feels thrown together, there are the odd glitches, and it only lasts about 6 hours. As for the variety of enemies? You can count em on one hand. 5.5 from me.\nIt's the same old story, great graphics and music, but average gameplay and length.

He described a tough fight that is coming at the cost of many Afghan casualties.\nArmy Gen. John Nicholson said many of the Afghan deaths are in battles over checkpoints, where there are often a small number of forces who are poorly led, ill-equipped and not well trained. He said over the next year the U.S.-led coalition will work to help the Afghans expand their control in the country and beef up their ability to sustain the fight.\nAt the same time, he said, there are up to 1,300 Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, mainly in the east, and they receive money, command-and-control guidance and communications support from Islamic State leaders in Syria.\nU.S. and Afghan military operations have targeted the group, killing many leaders and members, so he said they are in fewer Afghan districts now than they were months ago. Nicholson said the fighting has pushed them down into the mountains of southern Nangarhar and they are primarily in three to four districts, compared with the 10 districts they held last year.\nOn Thursday, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described the Afghanistan fight as a stalemate, after 15 years of war. And he told a Senate committee that the Afghan government controlled about 70 percent of the country.\nOn Friday, Nicholson provided more details, and acknowledged there is an \"equilibrium\" between the government and the enemy.\n\"This is a positive in the sense of the majority of the population's under control of the government forces, and this is primarily the population centers and so on. And then the enemy is primarily in more rural areas that have less impact on the future of the country,\" Nicholson said during a Pentagon press conference. \"It's something we're concerned about, but it is something that we're addressing with the Afghans and hoping to help them move forward next year.\"\nAsked about the Islamic State in Afghanistan, Nicholson said that military operations have cut the size of the group by about 25 percent this year and killed about a dozen leaders. He said they are still largely located in Nangarhar and are mainly previous members of the Pakistan Taliban who switched allegiances to the Islamic State group.\nWhile there has been financial support and leadership guidance from the main group in Syria, he said \"we haven't seen any large-scale convergence\" and there haven't been insurgents coming into Afghanistan from Syria.\nThere are currently about 14,000 U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, including 9,800 American forces. The number of U.S. troops will drop to 8,400 by the end of the year, based on President Barack Obama's decision in July.\nNicholson said that as part of the drawdown, the U.S. will shift some forces to other areas in the Middle East, and then focus more U.S. effort on advising Afghan troops in the east and south.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Taliban", "entity": "Taliban", "start": 4, "end": 11,

We\u2019ve known Daredevil would premiere a little early this year, thanks to leaks a few weeks ago, but this week Netflix took the promos a step further and released the first trailer for Daredevil Season 2. You can give it a watch, below.\nThe dark and ominous tone of the trailer is in a lot of ways reminiscent to the first trailer for Season 6 Game of Thrones put out a few weeks ago. Odd images from Matt Murdock\u2019s past play out on the screen while we get some voiceover narrative from the characters on the show. The trailer ends with glass breaking thanks to a new threat, and while it doesn\u2019t reveal a lot, it is bone chilling and at the end we learn Daredevil Season 2 will officially hit the schedule on Friday, March 18.\nIn addition, Marvel and Netflix have released the official synopsis for Season 2, which focuses on the additions of The Punisher, who will be played by Jon Bernthal, and Elektra, who will be played by Elodie Yung.\nWe've known the Punisher and Elektra would be big draws for a while now, and we've even heard a little bit about how Frank Castle will be introduced on the series, so beyond the trailer none of this is super new news, although I find that part about a \"life-altering choice\" to be really intriguing. And if all of that isn't enough to tide you over before Daredevil Season 2 moves forward, the subscription streaming service also released a new poster for the upcoming episodes.\nThe trailer and premiere announcement comes just a few days after early reports indicated that Marvel and Netflix might cheekily decide to release Daredevil on the same day that DC and Warner Bros. have planned to release Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Obviously, those rumors haven't held up, and Daredevil will only have the usual TV superhero competition to face off against when it hits the schedule on Friday, March 18 at 12:01 a.m. PT. In addition to the big Daredevil release announcement, you can check out when the rest of your favorites will be returning with our midseason TV premiere schedule.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Daredevil", "entity": "Daredevil (TV series)", "start": 157, "end": 166, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "Netflix", "entity": "Netflix", "start": 255, "end": 262, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Game of Thrones", "entity": "Game of Thrones", "start": 488, "end": 503, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "Matt Murdock", "entity": "Matt Murdock (Marvel Cinematic Universe)", "start": 545, "end": 557, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Murdock_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Netflix", "entity": "Netflix", "start": 896, "end": 903, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "The Punisher", "entity": "Punisher", "start": 988, "end": 1000, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Jon Bernthal", "entity": "Jon Bernthal", "start": 1024, "end": 1036, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bernthal", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Elektra", "entity": "Elektra (character)", "start": 1042, "end": 1049, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(character)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Elodie Yung", "entity": "\u00c9lodie Yung", "start": 1073, "end": 1084, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c9lodie_Yung", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Punisher", "entity": "Punisher", "start": 1102, "end": 1110, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Elektra", "entity": "Elektra (character)", "start": 1115, "end": 1122, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_(character)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Frank Castle", "entity": "Punisher", "start": 1203, "end": 1215, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punisher", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Netflix", "entity": "Netflix", "start": 1671, "end": 1678, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Daredevil", "entity": "Daredevil (TV series)", "start": 1712, "end": 1721, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "Warner Bros.", "entity": "Warner Bros.", "start": 1750, "end": 1762, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.ORGANIZATION"}, {"mention": "Daredevil", "entity": "Daredevil (TV series)", "start": 1868, "end": 1877, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}, {"mention": "Daredevil", "entity": "Daredevil (TV series)", "start": 2035, "end": 2044, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.WORK_OF_ART"}]}}

As a result, the bill under consideration expired.\nCongress has been battling over the farm bill, a crucial piece of legislation that covers the country\u2019s agricultural funding on top of conservation efforts and food aid, since early this year. The bill, which comes up for consideration twice a decade, is traditionally hailed as a point of bipartisanship between Republicans and Democrats. But this year, lawmakers in the House have been split along party lines on what should be included in the bill.\nThe Senate\u2019s version of the measure was uncontroversial and passed in June with 86-11 vote, reflecting much of the bipartisan collaboration traditional to the farm bill. But reconciling that version with the overwhelmingly partisan House bill has proved difficult. In particular, lawmakers have clashed over language in the House bill that adds work requirements to the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), a move that would knock an estimated 2 million people off food stamps. As reported by Mother Jones\u2018 Tom Philpott earlier this year, SNAP work requirements don\u2019t actually lead to increased employment.\nAside from SNAP, lawmakers have butted heads on issues ranging from sugar industry programs to conservation funding to school lunch.\nLawmakers had until September 30 to reconcile the conflicting versions of the bill. Unable to do so, the existing law has expired. SNAP is safe and unaffected for now\u2014though SNAP funding is a major part of the farm bill, it is an \u201cappropriated entitlement,\u201d meaning its year-to-year funding doesn\u2019t depend on the bill. Crop insurance is also safe, because it\u2019s authorized under the Federal Crop Insurance Act.\nBut other programs stop functioning, effective Monday. Some have already prepared for this: The Farm Service Agency issued a notice two weeks ago stating the agency will not be approving, processing, or authorizing any Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contracts starting October 1.\nAnd Ferd Hoefner, senior strategic adviser for the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, a grassroots group that advocates for agricultural policy change, says conservation programs like CRP and farm initiatives concerning organic, local, and regional food programs can\u2019t continue without the farm bill.\nAs for what\u2019s next, Hoefner says if Democrats win a majority in the House during the November midterms, they could use the November or December two-week sessions to push through a more bipartisan proposal.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Farm

The idea is that industry will pay a carbon tax, but so too will the average person. That would include having to pay extra at the pumps and on their natural gas and electricity utility bills.\n\"Absolutely,\" said Williams. \"A realization by the consumer is really important because if you want energy efficiency, if you want people to change their behaviours and affect the demand side, you have to get to those users.\"\nAlberta's next premier, Rachel Notley, will be sworn in this weekend.

The current system was provided by US-company Everyone Counts under a contract that will not cover the next state election in March 2015.\nAccording to Brightwell, before the iVote system is next used it will undergo some updates, primarily around the vote verification process.\n\u201cCurrently we only give a receipt which allows the elector to track that their vote has passed through our system and entered the count,\u201d he said. \u201cBest practice now is end-to-end verification of the vote.\nAt the time iVote system was initially procured, end-to-end verification was not an option as it poses numerous technical and electoral problems for which solutions are only now emerging, Brightwell said.\nAt the last NSW election, there were three times more voters using the iVote system than the electoral commission expected.\nDespite this, the system will remain much the same from the user\u2019s point of view, he said, with access to a Web browser or phone option which will use either dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology or a call centre approach.\nJust 218 blind and vision impaired voters (of a total 2259 iVote users) used the system at the last state election in March 2011, which offered only the DTMF option. The number of such voters increased some 400 per cent at a recent by-election in Clarence with the advent of the call centre option.\nDown the track, Brightwell did not rule out the development of an e-voting mobile application, as the number of voters using the Web interface via their smartphone continues to rise, but said it would not be without complications.\n\u201cWe know changing the layout

The image was sent to Cromwell's own house in Chelsea on the September 14, 1538. There it was burned publicly together with the statues of Walsingham, Ipswich and other images on September 26, 1538.\nIn spite of everything, the faithful continued to visit Penrhys and pray to Our Lady for four-hundred years. There is record of such devotion up until 1842, although barely a trace of the original shrine or buildings remained. But, in the early years of this century, little groups of pilgrims again wound their way up the mountainside to the well. In 1912, excavations were carried out which unearthed fragments of glass and tiles; and in the farm house, original timbers were found. A church was built at Ferndale two miles away from the shrine. It was built as a memorial church largely through the generosity and efforts of a Miss M. M. Davies of Llantrisant, a convert. The same devoted lady also procured for this church a beautiful oak replica of the ancient statue of Penrhys, standing in a richly carved tree trunk. This beautiful work of art can still be seen in Ferndale Church.\nIt was not until 1936 that the pilgrimages were revived, and it was about this time, in 1939, that the Rhondda Borough Council, took it upon themselves to preserve the historical well, and put railings around it for the first time. Two years later, the ground where the statue is situated, was given to Archbishop Mostyn for the Archdiocese of Cardiff, by Miss M. M. Davies. The pilgrimages had continued to come, even though there was no statue. The present statue was officially erected and blessed on the site itself, by Archbishop McGrath on July 2, 1953. It had been designed to resemble as near as possible the description of the original statue, found in Medieval Welsh poetry, and carved of Portland Stone.\nViv Condon informs us that, at present, there is a church in Ferndale, S. Wales dedicated to the Shrine of Our Lady of Penrhys which has \"a steady stream of visitors during the summer months and the church plays host and provides refreshments.\" She claims that the shrine dates back to the twelfth century and was very popular in its day.

{"id": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/why-halliburton-companys-stock-dropped-21-in-2014", "data": {"qa_pairs": [{"question": "Companies that provide investment advice", "target_entities": ["The Motley Fool"]}], "target_text": "Most investors will look back fondly at 2014 thanks to the stock market&apos;s 12% riseon the year. Energy investors, on the other hand, will remember 2014 as the year the price of oil plunged by nearly 50%, taking most oil stocks down with it. That rapid, unexpected fall ruined what had looked to bean exceptional year for oil-field services companyHalliburton, as this chart shows.\nHalliburton&apos;s stock handily outperformed the S&P 500 through midsummer. At one point it was up nearly 50% on the year. However, as oil prices began to roll over, so did Halliburton&apos;s stock price. While the announcement of a merger agreement with Baker Hugheshalted the stock&apos;s slide for a little while, the enthusiasm quickly evaporated as oil prices continued an unrelenting sell-off.\nWhy oil prices squeezed Halliburton&apos;s stockHalliburton makes its money by helping oil and gas companies drill new oil wells. With the price of oil now in the $50 per barrel range, oil companies are slashing capital expenses, which will impact Halliburton&apos;s growth and margins in 2015, and likely beyond.\nThe company is being proactive as oil prices fall. It has experienced the cyclicality of the oil market before and it knows how to survive the rough ride ahead of it.\nInvestor takeawayLast year started off great for Halliburton investors as the stock surged through the first six months. However, as oil prices turned so did the company&apos;s stock price. That being said, the fall in oil prices likely is what made Baker Hughes available, and that deal could pay big dividends down the road for Halliburton. So, while the company is bracing itself for slower growth and lower margins over the near term, it knows how to maneuver through a tough oil market to thrive once normalcy returns.\nThe article Why Halliburton Companys Stock Dropped 21% in 2014 originally appeared on Fool.com.\nMatt DiLallo has the following options: short January 2016 $32.5 puts on Kinder Morgan and long January 2016 $32.5 calls on Kinder Morgan.

It\u2019s largely similar to its contemporaries, but is unique in offering both a standard Android tablet menu \u2014 complete with all the apps, notifications and distractions you\u2019d expect \u2014 and a pared-down, reading-focused interface, which disables all distractions and offers access to Kobo\u2019s growing library of graphic novels and interactive kids\u2019 books alongside classic eBook fare.\nA $249.95 16GB and $299.95 32GB 7-inch version of the Arc HD will also be available when the tablet line-up is released, as will a $199.95 8GB non-HD variant. All will use the same dual-mode interface. All Kobo\u2019s Arc devices are designed to retain the entire feature-set of an Android tablet, with unrestricted access to the Google Play store and plenty of processing power, but the company is banking on its history as a book-seller to appeal to parents and occasional readers.\nThe Kobo Arc 7 and 7 HD tablets.\nPart of this appeal is a move to offer more immersive and interactive content through the Kobo eBook store \u2014 including children\u2019s literature like the Hairy Maclary series, and to further increase the appeal of its eBook library with curated, Pinterest-esque \u2018Collections\u2019 of related content, including author interviews, soundtracks, videos and audio tied in with traditional eBook titles.\nThe Kobo Aura 6-inch eReader.\nFar from switching its attention entirely to multimedia tablets, though, Kobo also has a new eReader in the Aura. With the Aura HD remaining popular, the Aura is a pared-down version of the existing flagship, transferring the HD\u2019s 1GHz processor and 4GB of storage into a slightly smaller 6-inch eReader with a 212ppi Pearl eInk screen, with a Comfortlight screen light also built in.

The League of Women Voters urges you to vote yes.\nAs many Ohioans know, our state is one of the most severely gerrymandered in the country. For decades, politicians have drawn political maps that allow them to choose their voters (and have not allowed voters to choose their representatives). Rather than bringing a lawsuit to protest our state's gerrymandered districts, the League of Women Voters of Ohio chose to promote measures for reform.\nTransparency: There must be at least two hearings on any plan and the public can submit proposed maps. These transparency and voter-participation provisions offer particularly strong protection against biased map-making.\nSusan Murnane is co-president of the League of Women Voters of Greater Cleveland.\nThis proposal is the result of a rare bipartisan agreement in the state legislature, negotiated by lawmakers from both parties with the Fair Districts=Fair Elections Coalition, of which the League of Women Voters of Ohio is a founding member. And both the Ohio Republican Party and the Ohio Democratic Party have endorsed Issue 1.\nCleveland.com's Rich Exner conducted a detailed analysis of \"best maps\" and \"worst maps\" using the Issue 1 standards. He concluded that even the worst-case maps are better than what we have now.\nWe believe that \"worst-case\" maps will be avoided by two key safeguards in Issue 1: It requires at least two public hearings on any map, and it gives Ohioans the tools to submit their own maps. These transparency requirements offer strong protections for the public.\nCompact districts, with a limit on splitting communities and counties. Sixty-five counties cannot be split, 18 can be split once, five (including Cuyahoga County) can be split twice, none can be split more than twice. Right now, Cuyahoga County is split three times -- into four different districts that cross county lines.\nTransparency: There must be at least two hearings on any plan and the public can submit proposed maps.\nYou do not need to declare a political party to vote for Issue 1 in May; you can request a nonpartisan \"issues-only\" ballot.\nThe League of Women Voters of Ohio and local Leagues across the state, including the League of Women Voters of Greater Cleveland, have been working to reform our broken congressional districting process for more than 30 years. Issue 1 presents our best chance at real reform. Vote yes on Issue 1, to put congressional district reform in the Ohio constitution.\nMarcia Goldberg and Susan Murnane are co-presidents of the League of Women Voters of Greater Cleveland.",

Now, it gets even better as we have a video to show you that really demonstrates what the beast can handle \u2013 Skyrim on ultra high settings.\nIf you thought the initial CES unveiling of Project Fiona was impressive, then you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. As we have already told you, information on hardware specs for Project Fiona are still being kept a secret at the moment, but Razer was keen to announce that their gaming tablet will be running on an third-generation Intel Core i7 processor and will include motion support via an accelerometer and rumble support as well.\nNow though, who needs to know the exact details of what it can run when they are already confirming it can run games like Skyrim on max settings? To prove it, a video shot by Destructoid at CES 2012 shows Bethesda\u2019s latest RPG epic running with a 1280\u00c3\u2014800 resolution and based on the video, it looks pretty incredible on a portable device too with no major signs of framerate problems.\nIt has already been said by Razer that their tablet will be able to run current PC games available today such as Skyrim seen in the video, but another aspect to point out to you is that Skyrim was actually in fact booted up from Steam, so it can run Valve\u2019s interface and presumably all their vast collection of titles with no problems either.\nProject Razer is looking amazing so far no doubt and a fantastic prospect ahead for the future of real PC portable gaming. The one stumbling block though will obviously be the high-price attached with this device, as we already know that Razer has given it a sub-$1000 bracket for the time being.

Since the most recent recession began, unemployment rates have fallen steadily across demographic groups.\nThe overall unemployment rate hit 3.8 percent, the lowest it has been since April 2000. Since 1955, after a postwar period of below-3-percent unemployment, the rate has been lower than it is now \u2014 3.8 percent \u2014 in 27 months. Before 2000, the most recent time the unemployment rate was so low was in 1970.\nBut another metric hit a historic number. The unemployment rate among black Americans is now at 5.9 percent, the lowest it has ever been recorded.\nThere are two caveats to that data point. The first is that the government began tracking the figure in 1972. The second is that the metric is volatile. Between December 2017 and January, it jumped nearly a percentage point. That complicated Trump\u2019s frequent use of the figure to demonstrate how he has delivered for black voters during his State of the Union address. The number recovered in February.\nPerhaps as important, the black unemployment rate has never been closer to the white unemployment rate. The improvement in unemployment that\u2019s been seen since the end of the recession is one thing, but black unemployment has consistently been at least 66 percent higher than the white unemployment rate. As of May, it was 69 percent higher, the lowest since the depth of the recession.\nThat\u2019s an important date to note. Usually when black unemployment draws closer to white unemployment, it\u2019s a function of spiking white unemployment rates. (That\u2019s what happened in 1975, too.) That\u2019s not the case now.\nAs of May, the black unemployment rate is 2.4 points higher than the white unemployment rate, the first time it has ever been less than 3 points higher.\nHow much of this is a function of Trump\u2019s leadership is unclear, as is the effort to determine the relationship between any president and major economic indicators. Since he has been president, the overall unemployment rate has fallen one point, and the black unemployment rate has fallen nearly two points.\nThe subtlety of the relationship between a president\u2019s actions and improving economic conditions may, we suspect, be lost in Trump\u2019s rhetoric about this historic new low.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "U.S.", "entity": "United States", "start": 79, "end": 83, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.LOCATION"}, {"mention": "President", "entity": "Donald Trump", "start": 109, "end": 118, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Trump", "entity": "Donald Trump", "start": 119, "end": 124, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Twitter", "entity": "Twitter", "start": 127, "end": 134, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.OTHER"}, {"mention": "Americans", "entity": "Americans", "start": 648, "end": 657, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Trump", "entity": "Donald Trump", "start": 961, "end": 966, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Trump", "entity": "Donald Trump", "start": 1912, "end": 1917, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "president", "entity": "Donald Trump", "start": 2061, "end": 2070, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}, {"mention": "Trump", "entity": "Donald Trump", "start": 2311, "end": 2316, "label": null, "wikipedia_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "evidence": null, "gcp_entity_type": "Type.PERSON"}]}}

But later this year, both of those software programs could find themselves sidelined by Slack.\nThe makers behind the chat app announced yesterday that Slack users who are messaging each other will soon be able to have a voice call as well, and eventually a video call. No timeline has been given for either feature.\nSlack\u2019s rapid rise has already made it a darling of Silicon Valley. Just a year after its launch, investors valued the business chat app at over $1 billion. It was pegged at $2.8 billion as of last April, despite annual recurring revenues of just $25 million. That valuation is thanks to Slack\u2019s fast-growing, devoted customer base, which has skyrocketed from 500,000 daily active users in January 2015 to 2.3 million daily active users today.\nWhat percentage of these users are also Skype or Google Hangout users is impossible to say, but judging by purely anecdotal evidence from people in the tech and new media world, there\u2019s huge crossover. Most people who use Slack for business use a combination of Skype and Google Hangouts when they need to talk to someone face-to-face. But a majority of their time remains inside Slack, where they can write text messages to individual colleagues as well as set up team channels, upload gifs, and use special tools.\nGoogle is likely indifferent to Slack\u2019s rise. It makes almost all of its money from advertisements, and options like Google Hangouts are just there to keep users close to the search bar.\nBut Skype is a different story.\nSkype, which is part of Microsoft, is mostly a two-trick app, and used for voice and video calls. Skype probably has more users that Slack right now, but some of its most valuable, paying \u201cbusiness\u201d users are likely to fall into that \u201calso using Slack\u201d category. The company claimed 300 million monthly active users as of date, and had 4.9 million active daily users at the end of 2014, the latest daily data available.\nSkype for Business, the app\u2019s business-centric upgrade, is only a hair more sophisticated than regular Skype, which at the ripe old age of 12 both looks and feels dated. It has none of the bells and whistles that make Slack addictive in the first place. Adding voice and video calling to Slack could help businesses use one tool for nearly all communication purposes.\nSkype is owned by Microsoft, and accounts for a tiny percentage of the $93 billion in sales Microsoft brought in last year (they aren\u2019t broken out, but in 2013 Microsoft told Bloomberg Skype was set to bring in $2 billion in annual sales). Microsoft has been focusing on Windows Azure, an Amazon Web Services competitor, and revamping Skype is probably not a major priority. Microsoft did not respond to Quartz\u2019s requests for comment on this piece.\nBut how many young companies are using Outlook? If internet history tells us anything, Skype is on its way to becoming the AOL of voice and video calling apps.", "entity_info": [{"mention": "Slack", "entity": "Slack (software)", "start": 269,
